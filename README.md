# Churn Prediction – Telco Customer Retention

## Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecommunications industry, as losing customers directly impacts long-term revenue. This project focuses on **predicting customer churn probability** using historical customer behavior data and evaluating the model from a **business impact perspective**.

Instead of only measuring model accuracy, this project emphasizes how machine learning can support **data-driven retention strategies**, helping companies reduce unnecessary costs while minimizing revenue loss due to churn.

## Problem Statement
How can a Telco company reduce customer churn by identifying customers who are likely to leave and applying targeted retention strategies effectively?

## Approach
- Analyze historical customer behavior to understand churn patterns
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train and compare multiple classification models
- Evaluate models using business-relevant metrics such as **recall, precision, and ROC-AUC**
- Translate model performance into **cost and revenue impact** through business simulations

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
